# languid
Library and executable for language training

Uses an XML encoding for dictionaries


## langtest.hs

text-based interface: you can pick to do
  read-testing: guess the translation of a word
  write-testing: guess the word, given the translation
  look-up: search a work, add it if it's not in the dictionary
  
## languid.hs
  GUI interface that uses gi-gtk
  Unfortunately it doesn't work any longer
    (error in installing the gi-gtk package)

Maybe an issue with my cabal settings
