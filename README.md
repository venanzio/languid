# languid
Library and executable for language training


## langtest.hs
text-based interface: you can choose to do
  read-testing: guess the translation of a word
  write-testing: guess the word, given the translation
  look-up: search a work, add it if it's not in the dictionary
  
## languid.hs
  GUI interface that uses gi-gtk
  Unfortunately it doesn't work any longer

Maybe an issue with my cabal settings
